This is zen based subtheme for a small restaurant in the Twin Cities. 

This was themed for a specific site and is not likely to be useful to anyone else for anything other than a code sample. However, feel free to take a look and if you have any comments, let me know.

For this site almost all of the content is placed using blocks. So, I used a very simple custom module that involks hook_menu to generate the paths for each page. 

At this time, it's still a work in progress.
